## coding-wars-with-R
Repo for storing and tracking my coding-wars challenges

### Some Context
Some time ago I switched from coding primarily in Python, to falling in love with R and using it as my primary language for data science.

I love the philosophy underlying doing data science with R. Primarily, I'm referring to the Tidyverse, etc. and all of the lovely work that falls under the unbrella of *R for Data Science* by **Wickham & Grolemund.**

### The Why behind Coding-Wars
Because of my switch from Python to R, I need to practice general coding skills in R to continue building a Solid Foundation. To do that, I've decided to use coding-challenges; what a better way to learn, than solving some intersting challenges.

I'll be using a mixture of Base R and other packages suchas dplyr, stingr, etc.

## Happy Coding!
