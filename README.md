## Problem Solving Framework: Understand Problem -> Plan Solution -> Divide + Conquer!

**My objective is to improve efficiancy and effectiveness of my coding abilities in R.**

This means that in the beginning, I'll be trading efficiancy for pushing towards a solution even if it is not a good one. More specifically, I want to:
1. Solve each challenge on my own and 
2. **Then, study other solutions to learn and optimize my own coding abilities.**

## Happy Coding!
